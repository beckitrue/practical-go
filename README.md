# README

I'm using this repo to store my code from the Practical Go courses from [Ardan Labs](https://www.ardanlabs.com/).

## Dev Enviornment

I'm now using a devcontainer as my go development environment. I configured the container to use the same 
setup I use on my laptop by loading my [dotfiles](https://github.com/beckitrue/dotfiles) into the 
container. It also loads all my Neovim plugins, so my setup is just like it is on laptop.

I've also used this time to learn how to use Copilot with the [Copilot plugin](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim) on nvim.
